Built with React and Next.js.

This is the webpage I created for my application for the HackIllinois Systems Team.

```

- The server will be running on port 3000 ([http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000))

## Running in Production Mode

- Follow all the same steps as for development mode, up until starting the development server
